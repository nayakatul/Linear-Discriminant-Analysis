# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis

This is an implementation of Linear Discriminant Analysis on the Universal Bank dataset.
The dataset contains information about 1500 customers of a rapidly growing bank. The bank's goal is to expand its customer base, particularly focusing on converting liability customers to personal loan customers. The dataset provides insights into customer demographic information, relationships with the bank, and customer responses to a previous personal loan campaign.

The dataset contains the following features:

ID: Unique identifier for each customer
Age: Customer's age
Experience: Years of professional experience
Income: Annual income of the customer (in thousands of dollars)
Family: Family size of the customer
CCAvg: Average spending on credit cards per month (in thousands of dollars)
Education: Education level of the customer, with three categories: 1 - Undergraduate, 2 - Graduate, 3 - Advanced/Professional
Mortgage: Value of house mortgage, if any (in thousands of dollars)
Personal Loan: Whether the customer accepted a personal loan offered in the previous campaign (1 - Yes, 0 - No)
Securities Account: Whether the customer has a securities account with the bank (1 - Yes, 0 - No)
CD Account: Whether the customer has a certificate of deposit (CD) account with the bank (1 - Yes, 0 - No)
Online: Whether the customer uses internet banking facilities (1 - Yes, 0 - No)
CreditCard: Whether the customer uses a credit card issued by the bank (1 - Yes, 0 - No)

The objective of analyzing this dataset is to identify factors that influence a customer's likelihood to accept a personal loan. Understanding these factors will help the bank devise smarter marketing campaigns to convert more liability customers into personal loan customers.
