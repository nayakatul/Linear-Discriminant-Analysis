# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis

This is an implementation of Linear Discriminant Analysis on the Universal Bank dataset without in-built functions.

The dataset contains information about 1500 customers of a rapidly growing bank. The bank's goal is to expand its customer base, particularly focusing on converting liability customers to personal loan customers. The dataset provides insights into customer demographic information, relationships with the bank, and customer responses to a previous personal loan campaign.

The dataset contains the following features: ID, Age, Experience, Income, Family, CCAvg, Education, Mortgage, Personal Loan, Securities Account, CD Account, Online, CreditCard

The objective of analyzing this dataset is to identify factors that influence a customer's likelihood to accept a personal loan. Understanding these factors will help the bank devise smarter marketing campaigns to convert more liability customers into personal loan customers.
